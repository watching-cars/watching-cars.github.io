        <p><h2>KIA CERATO \ PRICE:350,000</h2></p><p>(also known as the Kia Forte in the United States, K3 in South Korea or the Forte K3 or Shuma in China) is a compact car produced by the South Korean manufacturer Kia since 2003. In 2008, the Cerato nameplate was replaced by the Forte nameplate in the North American market and the K3 nameplate in South Korea. However, the "Cerato" name remains in use in markets such as Australasia and Latin America. It is available in five-door hatchback, two-door coupe and four-door sedan variants. It is not available in Europe, where the similar sized Kia Ceed is offered (except for Russia and Ukraine, where the Cee'd and the Cerato are both available).</p>

<p>In some markets, such as North America, the Cerato is marketed as the Kia Forte replacing the Spectra nameplate of previous generations. In Colombia and Singapore, the name Cerato Forte was used for the second generation,[1] while Naza Automotive Manufacturing of Malaysia has assembled the vehicle since 2009, selling it there under the name Naza Forte.[2]</p>

        <p><h2>KIA RIO \ PRICE:250,000</h2></p><p>The Kia Rio (Korean: 기아 리오) is a subcompact car manufactured by Kia since November 1999 and now in its fourth generation. Body styles have included a three and five-door hatchback and four-door sedan, equipped with inline-four gasoline and diesel engines, and front-wheel drive.

            The Rio replaced the first generation Pride—a rebadged version of the Ford Festiva—and the Avella, a subcompact sold as a Ford in some markets. A second generation was introduced in 2005 in Europe and 2006 in North America, sharing its platform with the Hyundai Accent, a subcompact manufactured by its sister Hyundai Motor Company in South Korea.</p>

        <p><h2>KIA XCEED \ PRICE:400,00</h2></p><p>The Kia Ceed (known as the Kia cee'd before 2018) is a compact car produced by the South Korean manufacturer Kia since 2006 exclusively for the European market. The Ceed was first unveiled in 28 September 2006 at the Paris Motor Show. In mid-2007, the station wagon version called the cee'd_sw was launched followed by the three-door pro_cee'd in early 2008. The second generation of the cee'd was presented at the Geneva Motor Show 2012. At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, Kia presented the third generation Ceed. In September 2019, Kia also unveiled the XCeed, a crossover SUV based on the third generation Ceed.

            It is the first Kia vehicle to be designed entirely in Europe and tailored to European customers. To mark the occasion, Kia took the initials of the European Economic Community, EEC or CEE in several languages and added ED for European Design. Realizing that "CEEED" had too many ‘E's, they replaced the last 'E' with an apostrophe, with 'Cee'd' being the end result. Since 2018, the Ceed name does not include an apostrophe. The initials now mean "Community of Europe, with European Design".[1] The model has been manufactured at the Kia Motors Slovakia assembly plant in Žilina since October 2006.[2] The Ceed replaced the Cerato which had little success in Europe, and is positioned between the Rio supermini (B-segment) and the Optima mid-size car (D-segment).</p>
