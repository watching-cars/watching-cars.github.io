	<summary><b>Mercedes Model 2022</b></summary>
<p>The 2022 model year could be the inflection point for Mercedes-Benz. For more than 135 years, the automaker has been developing the internal combustion engine, with Benz cited for developing the world's first practical ICE car—a three-wheel tricycle. Now, the engineering wizards in Germany expand their EQ electric vehicle lineup for 2022 while simultaneously suspending production of its V-8 engines</a>.</p>

	<h3> 2019 Mercedes-Benz Performace & Overview</h3>
	<p>Numerous driver assists monitor your surroundings and either issue warnings or take action to prevent accidents. When it detects signs of drowsiness, ATTENTION ASSIST® can wake you with audio-visual alerts. Adaptive braking technology can improve responsiveness if you lift your foot off the accelerator pedal quickly by adding the correct amount of stopping pressure. To prevent your sedan from being blown off the freeway by strong gusts, Crosswind Assist strategically brakes wheels on one side. The optional Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC® puts a safe distance between you and the car ahead, automatically decreasing or increasing your speed to adjust to changing traffic flow. Available Active Blind Spot Assist warns of intrusions into your blind zone. If you try to change lanes, it brakes selected wheels to steady you where you are to prevent a side collision. You can also get help pulling into a spot with available Active Parking Assist, which takes care of steering, braking, and shifting.
<br><br>
Do your high aspirations deserve to be met? Then test drive the 2019 Mercedes-Benz E-Class at Walter’s Mercedes-Benz of Riverside, CA.<br>

If you’re looking to this vehicle as transportation for your loved ones, you’ll be reassured by all the built-in or available protective systems.

	<summary ><b>Mercedes Model 2018</b></summary>
	<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA 250 is a luxury SUV that provides you potent performance, along with a host of innovative technologies that are sure to please any California driver. Why pay more for a top-level trim of an economy brand SUV such as a 2018 Honda CR-V or 2018 Toyota RAV4, or spend more on an SUV such as the 2018 Acura RDX or 2018 INFINITI QX30, when you could take home new Mercedes-Benz SUV for <mark>less?</mark></p>
	<p>Get behind the wheel of the 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA 250 and explore the roads of Riverside County in style. The 2018 GLA 250 comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbo engine that produces an impressive 208 horsepower, which is far greater than top-level trims of the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. This expertly engineered powertrain also allows you to earn up to 33 highway mpg, which is more than both the 2018 RAV4 and 2018 RDX can offer. Looking for another reason to step up into a new 2018 GLA 250? You’ll discover that the starting MSRP of the 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA 250 SUV is on par with, if not less than, every car listed in our chart above. Why pay more for a higher trim level when you can command the respect that the Mercedes-Benz name demands — all at a price point that’s right within your grasp.</p>
