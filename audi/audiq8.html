    <h1>New presence for the Q family:</h1>
    <h1>the exterior design</h1>
    <p>With the imposing Singleframe in octagonal design, the Audi Q8 is the new face of the Q family. The brawny<br>
       radiator grille stands upright and, together with the spoiler that has been drawn toward the front and the large,<br>
       highly contoured air inlets, emphasizes the self-confident look. The elegantly sloping roofline terminates in gently<br>
       inclined D-pillars and rests against the quattro blisters above the wheel arches of house up to 21-inch wheels for<br>
       the S-line and 22-inch for the S-line Plus package.<p>

     <p>The purely mechanical center differential transfers the forces to the front<br>
       axle and rear axle at a ratio of 40:60 as standard. When required, it<br>
       transfers the majority to the axle with the better traction.Besides the<br>
       standard progressive steering, whose steering ratio becomes increasingly<br>
       direct the further the steering wheel is turned, Audi also offers the option<br>
       of all-wheel steering. It can turn the rear wheels as much as 5 degrees –<br>
       counter to the direction of the turn at low speeds to increase agility and at<br>
       higher speeds in the direction of the turn for better stability. All drive<br>
       systems are particularly efficient thanks to the new mild hybrid technology (MHEV).</p>

     <p>A broad, horizontal dashboard and a selection of interior inlay helps keeping you connected by<br>
       design. In the dark, the contour light traces the distinctive design lines of the interior – an example<br>
       for the love of detail at Audi.</p>
